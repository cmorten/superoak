## [3.0.0] - 12-12-2020

- feat: upgrade to `superdeno@3.0.0` - **BREAKING CHANGE** support
  [superagent `.redirects(n)` API](https://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/#following-redirects),
  with a default of `0`.

The consequence of upgrading superdeno to support the `.redirects(n)` API is
that superoak follows a default of `0` redirects, for parity with
[supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest/blob/master/lib/test.js#L32).
If your test requires superoak to follow multiple redirects, specify the number
of redirects required in `.redirects(n)`, or use `-1` to have superoak follow
all redirects.
